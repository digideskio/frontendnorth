The cost of serving static sites has never been lower. <br><br>And front-end development practices have never been richer. Couldn't we harness this better and make life simpler without dumbing down?In this talk we'll explore some unexpected capabilities and characteristics of "static" sites. We'll look at ways to use emerging tools and services to create robust, high performance websites which can be more dynamic than some of their heavier and more costly brothers and sisters.</td>

We took wild journeys of fantasy where every object in front of us had possibilities. This talk will cover the concept of play as a cognitive developer, examine case studies where play and imagination contributed to amazing product design, and give some ideas as to how we can continue to do this with our team and on our own everyday to help strengthen our "play" muscles.</td>

			    <td class="desc">The BBC provides many online products and services such as Sport, News, iPlayer which are designed, delivered and managed by numerous teams around the country within BBC Future Media. Despite the different products, features and technologies employed by BBC, the experience remains constant and is underpinned by the BBC's Global Experience Language (GEL). <br><br>GEL stipulates a series of guidelines which define anything from typography and grid structure, to how an accordion or search field should look. I’ve recently began investigating how these, currently, static PDF documents could be turned into code that can be shared and reused across the BBC and what challenges this raises. This talk will cover challenges such as what could a code implementation of these guidelines look like? How could we distribute and manage it? What benefits does this shared code give us?</td>
